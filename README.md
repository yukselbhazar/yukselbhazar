<h2 align="left">Hello <s>World</s> Visitor ðŸ‘‹</h2>

I currently operate as an Infra Expert at <a href="https://guidion.com/" target="_blank">De Monteur</a>, primarily focusing on Fiber network deployment, configuration and troubleshooting. Alongside this, I study Information Technology at Hogeschool Utrecht. While I have a broad range of interests within IT, Iâ€™m particularly drawn to quantum computing, networking and various cybersecurity topics, such as digital forensics.

I also enjoy software development and, when time allows, contribute to or develop open-source projects, which is what the public part of my GitHub is dedicated to. I aim to create tools that others can freely benefit from. Feel free to browse, use, or contribute to them through my profile with the respective licenses in mind.
